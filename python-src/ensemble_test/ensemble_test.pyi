# This is a stub file.
# It is used to provide useful type annotations on IDEs (e.g., VS Code).
#
# It is not automatically updated, so it has to be manually updated
# every time new classes or methods are declared in the Rust backend.
#
# Not properly updating this file doesn't affect its ability to be used
# in a Python project, it's just that there won't be type annotations
# from the IDE.
